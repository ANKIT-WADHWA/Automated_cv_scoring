with the live demo screenshots attached
```
## Project Overview
This project automates the process of collecting resumes from emails, extracting relevant information, scoring them based on the job description, and providing personalized feedback to candidates via email. The agent uses the Gmail API for email interaction and processes resumes in PDF and DOCX formats. The feedback includes details on AI experience, CV score, and job description match score.

## Features
- **Resume Collection:** Collects unread resumes from Gmail inbox.
- **Resume Scoring:** Scores the resumes based on predefined criteria (AI experience, skills, job description match).
- **Email Automation:** Sends personalized feedback to candidates via email.
- **Logging:** Tracks processed resumes with a timestamp and stores them in a CSV file.

## Code Structure
- `email_collector.py`: Handles Gmail API integration to collect resumes from emails.
- `email_sender.py`: Sends feedback emails to candidates.
- `gmail_auth.py`: Handles Gmail OAuth authentication.
- `logging_custom.py`: Logs processed resumes to a CSV file.
- `resume_scoring.py`: Extracts resume information, including skills, experience, and education, and scores them.
- `main.py`: The main script that automates the entire process.
